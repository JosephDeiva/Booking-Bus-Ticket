This C code implements a simple bus ticket booking system. Here's a brief description of its functionality:

1. **Struct Definition**: Defines a structure `new_fun` to store booking details such as passenger name, phone number, departure and arrival places, and seat number.

2. **Function Prototypes**: Prototypes functions for viewing booking status, calculating remaining seats, and checking seat availability.

3. **Main Function**: 
    - Displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter booking details such as name, mobile number, departure and arrival places.
    - Calculates the fare based on the departure and arrival places.
    - Displays available seats and prompts the user to select a seat.
    - Simulates a payment process.
    - Writes the booking details to a CSV file.
    - Calls functions to view booking status and calculate remaining seats.

4. **View Booking Status Function**: Reads booking details from the CSV file and displays them.

5. **Calculate Remaining Seats Function**: Calculates the remaining seats by reading the CSV file and deducting the booked seats from the total. Allows the user to add one more seat for another person if desired.

6. **Check Function**: Checks if a seat is available by searching for it in the CSV file.

Overall, the code provides a basic framework for booking bus tickets, storing booking details, and managing seat availability. However, there are areas for improvement such as error handling, input validation, and code organization.
